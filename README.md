The Anti-Money-Laundry-Scraper is a tool that can help track and identify instances of money laundering by crawling through publicly available data sources and extracting relevant information. This information can then be used by financial institutions, law enforcement agencies, and other organizations to detect and prevent money laundering.

## How to Use the Anti-Money-Laundry-Scraper

The Anti-Money-Laundry-Scraper is easy to use and can be integrated into your existing Python-based projects. To use the scraper, simply import the `anti_money_laundry_scraper` module and use the `crawl()` function, passing in the URL of the data source you want to scrape.

```python
from anti_money_laundry_scraper import crawl

url = "https://www.un.org/en/sections/issues-depth/money-laundering/"
data = crawl(url)
```

This will return a list of dictionaries, each containing information about a specific instance of money laundering that was identified by the scraper.
